I know the croaking from the Frogs of Aristophanes
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's Din afore
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinapinafore

When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin
When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more Wary at
And when I know precisely what is meant by "Commissariat"
When I have learnt what progress has been made in Modern gunnery
When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy
You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a gee
You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a gee
You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a gee
You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a sat a Gee

But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral

But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral
He is the very model of a modern Major-General
